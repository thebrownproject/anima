{"id":"stackdocs-kfn","title":"Fix Sprite↔Bridge WebSocket communication through TCP proxy","description":"## Problem\n\nMessages sent through the Sprites.dev TCP proxy to the Sprite's WebSocket server on port 8765 are not being received by the gateway, OR the gateway processes them but the agent response times out.\n\n## What We Know\n\n### Working:\n- Sprite server starts fine (Database connects, WS server listens on 0.0.0.0:8765)\n- TCP proxy connects successfully (status: connected, target: 10.0.0.1:8765)\n- Claude Agent SDK is installed and finds bundled CLI binary\n- API key proxy on Bridge deployed and returns 401 without token (correct)\n- From INSIDE the Sprite: local Python WS client connects, gateway receives mission, SDK launches claude binary\n- Fly.io secrets set: SPRITES_PROXY_TOKEN, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, MISTRAL_API_KEY\n\n### Broken:\n- Messages sent through TCP proxy → 0 events received back (60s timeout)\n- From inside Sprite: gateway receives mission, SDK starts, but no agent_event messages return within 60s\n\n### Bugs Found \u0026 Fixed This Session:\n1. **Relative import error**: server.py used relative imports but was run as script. Fixed: `bash -c 'cd /workspace \u0026\u0026 python3 -m src.server'`\n2. **Timestamp validation**: `is_websocket_message()` expects numeric timestamp (Unix epoch ms), test was sending ISO string. Fixed in test, but ALL callers must use `Date.now()` not `new Date().toISOString()`\n3. **Port 8765 stale**: Old server processes survive Sprite sleep/wake (CRIU). Must kill before restart.\n4. **TCP proxy init format**: Proxy returns `{type:'port_opened'}` then `{status:'connected'}`. Bridge sprite-connection.ts only checks for `status:'connected'` — works but should handle both.\n\n### Two Remaining Issues to Investigate:\n1. **TCP proxy message forwarding**: Do WS messages sent through the outer WS tunnel actually reach the Sprite's WS server as WS frames? The proxy creates a TCP connection — does it perform WS upgrade or just raw TCP? Server logs show `Connection opened` from localhost client but we need to verify proxy connections appear.\n2. **Agent SDK timeout**: Even from inside the Sprite (bypassing proxy), the SDK launches claude but no events stream back within 60s. Is the API call through the proxy failing silently? Check: is ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL being read correctly by the bundled CLI? Does the proxy token auth work end-to-end?\n\n## Files Involved\n- `bridge/src/api-proxy.ts` — HTTP reverse proxy (new, 130 lines)\n- `bridge/src/provisioning.ts` — Server command, env vars\n- `bridge/src/sprite-connection.ts` — TCP proxy client\n- `sprite/src/server.py` — WS server entry\n- `sprite/src/gateway.py` — Message router\n- `sprite/src/runtime.py` — Agent runtime (new, 141 lines)\n- `sprite/src/protocol.py` — is_websocket_message validation\n- `bridge/scripts/test-e2e-v2.ts` — E2E test script\n- `bridge/scripts/check-sprite.ts` — Sprite diagnostic script\n\n## Test Sprite\n- Name: `sd-e2e-test` (bootstrapped, VERSION=2, all packages installed)\n- Server command: `cd /workspace \u0026\u0026 python3 -m src.server`\n\n## Next Steps\n1. SSH/exec into Sprite, start server with real proxy token, test from inside with verbose SDK logging\n2. Verify the proxy token + ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL actually reaches Anthropic via Bridge proxy\n3. If SDK works from inside, investigate TCP proxy WS frame forwarding\n4.

WHERE ...\")` style calls. The Database class needs to provide async methods that the tool factory can call with raw SQL + params.\n\n## Implementation Guidance\n\n### Recommended Class Design\nBased on patterns observed in the codebase:\n\n1. **Single async class `Database`** with these methods:\n   - `__init__(self, db_path: str = \"/workspace/agent.db\")` -- configurable path for testing\n   - `async connect(self)` -- open aiosqlite connection, enable WAL, run schema init\n   - `async close(self)` -- close connection gracefully\n   - `async execute(self, sql, params)` -- write operations (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)\n   - `async executemany(self, sql, params_list)` -- batch writes\n   - `async fetchone(self, sql, params)` -- single row SELECT\n   - `async fetchall(self, sql, params)` -- multi-row SELECT\n   - `async query(self, sql, params)` -- alias or general-purpose method (m7b.3.2 expects this name)\n   - Context manager support (`async with Database() as db:`)\n\n2. **Schema initialization**: Embed the CREATE TABLE statements directly (matching bootstrap.ts exactly). Run on connect. Use IF NOT EXISTS for idempotency.\n\n3. **WAL mode**: Set `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` immediately after connect. This allows concurrent reads while writing.\n\n4. **Row factory**: Use `aiosqlite.Row` or return dicts (sqlite3.Row with dict() wrapper) so downstream tools get dict-like access to columns.\n\n5. **Default path constant**: `DEFAULT_DB_PATH = \"/workspace/agent.db\"` -- override in tests with tmp_path.\n\n### File Structure\n- Create: `sprite/src/database.py` (~100-150 lines target)\n- Create: `sprite/tests/test_database.py`\n\n### Testing Pattern (Follow existing test_server.py)\n- Use `pytest-asyncio` with `asyncio_mode = \"auto\"` (already configured in pyproject.toml)\n- Use `tmp_path` fixture for isolated DB files (no /workspace/ dependency in tests)\n- Test schema init, WAL mode, CRUD on each table, concurrent reads\n- Import style: `from src.database import Database` (matches test_server.py pattern)\n\n### Integration Points\n- **server.py**: Will eventually create a Database instance and pass it to SpriteGateway\n- **gateway.py**: Will pass Database reference to handlers which create agent tools\n- **m7b.3.2 tools**: Will receive Database as `db` parameter in create_tools factory, replacing Supabase Client\n\n## Risks\n\n1. **SCHEMA.md says /workspace/data/stackdocs.db but everything else says /workspace/agent.db** -- The spec, bootstrap code, ops docs, and golden sprite all use `/workspace/agent.db`. SCHEMA.md line 82 is wrong. Builder should use `/workspace/agent.db` and SCHEMA.md should be updated separately (not part of this task).\n\n2. **Bootstrap schema is in bridge/src/bootstrap.ts (TypeScript string literal)** -- The database.py schema MUST match this exactly, or sprites bootstrapped by Bridge will have a different schema than what database.py expects. Builder should copy the DDL from bootstrap.ts lines 51-89 verbatim.\n\n3. **WAL mode needs verification on Sprite env** -- WAL works on most Linux systems but is worth verifying in tests. The task acceptance criteria explicitly requires PRAGMA journal_mode returning 'wal'.\n\n4. **No migration system yet** -- Bootstrap creates tables, database.py will create tables on connect. When schema changes happen in future, there is no migration mechanism. For MVP this is fine (IF NOT EXISTS handles it), but worth noting.\n\n5. **JSON fields stored as TEXT** -- extracted_fields, confidence_scores, tags, custom_fields are all TEXT columns containing JSON strings. The Database class should NOT handle serialization/deserialization -- that belongs in the tool layer (m7b.3.2). Database should pass TEXT through as-is.\n\n6. **Connection handling** -- aiosqlite uses a single connection with thread-safe wrapper. For MVP (single connection, serialize writes), this is fine. The task description says \"single connection for MVP, serialize writes\". No pool needed.","created_at":"2026-02-07T11:38:27Z"}]}

The v2 agent uses Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob as primary tools -- NOT custom tool factories. This fundamentally changes the implementation:\n- **No MCP server registration for extraction tools.** The Claude Agent SDK (wrapping Claude Code CLI) comes with built-in tools (Bash, Read, Write, etc.) out of the box.\n- **Custom tools needed only for:** Canvas updates (m7b.3.4, WebSocket messages) and OCR (Phase 4, external API call)\n- **soul.md replaces prompts.py.** The system prompt is a file at `/workspace/memory/soul.md` that describes the schema, file locations, and extraction workflow.\n\n### Claude Agent SDK Usage (v1 reference: `/Users/fraserbrown/stackdocs/backend/app/agents/extraction_agent/agent.py`)\nTwo usage patterns exist in v1:\n1. **`query()` function** (spike_agent_sdk.py, spike_resume.py): Simple async generator, yields messages. Used for one-shot queries. Pattern: `async for message in query(prompt=..., options=...):`\n2. **`ClaudeSDKClient` context manager** (spike_session.py, agent.py): Supports multiple queries in same session. Pattern: `async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=...) as client:` then `await client.query(prompt)` then `async for message in client.receive_response():`\n\n**Key SDK types imported:**\n- `ClaudeSDKClient` -- async context manager for multi-turn sessions\n- `ClaudeAgentOptions` -- config: `system_prompt`, `mcp_servers`, `allowed_tools`, `max_turns`, `resume` (session_id)\n- `AssistantMessage` -- contains `content: list[TextBlock | ToolUseBlock | ThinkingBlock]`, `model`, `error`\n- `TextBlock` -- has `.text` (user-facing response)\n- `ToolUseBlock` -- has `.name`, `.input`\n- `ThinkingBlock` -- has `.thinking`\n- `ResultMessage` -- has `.session_id`, `.total_cost_usd`, `.usage`, `.duration_ms`, `.num_turns`, `.is_error`\n- `SystemMessage` -- has `.subtype`, `.data`\n- `UserMessage` -- has `.content`\n- `create_sdk_mcp_server()` -- registers custom tools as MCP server (may still be needed for Canvas tools)\n\n**Session resume pattern** (from spike_resume.py): `ClaudeAgentOptions(resume=session_id, max_turns=1)` -- no system_prompt needed on resume (it was set in original session).\n\n### Existing Sprite Code\n\n**`/Users/fraserbrown/stackdocs/sprite/src/server.py` (59 lines)**\n- WebSocket server on port 8765, handles single connection from Bridge\n- Creates `SpriteGateway(send_fn=ws.send)` per connection\n- Routes raw WS messages through `gateway.route(raw)`\n- Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT\n\n**`/Users/fraserbrown/stackdocs/sprite/src/gateway.py` (113 lines)**\n- `SpriteGateway` class with `send_fn` (async callable), `mission_lock` (asyncio.Lock)\n- Routes messages by type: mission, file_upload, canvas_interaction, heartbeat, auth, system\n- **mission and heartbeat share the async lock** for serial execution\n- `_handle_mission()` is a STUB (line 73-75): logs payload, sends ack.

Takes `send_fn` (from gateway) and `db` (Database instance)\n2. Has `async def run_mission(text, request_id, attachments)` method\n3. Builds system prompt from soul.md (read from `/workspace/memory/soul.md`)\n4. Creates `ClaudeSDKClient` with `ClaudeAgentOptions`:\n   - `system_prompt` from soul.md content\n   - `allowed_tools` -- for MVP, the built-in tools are enough (Bash, Read, Write, etc. come free with Claude Code CLI). No MCP servers needed initially.\n   - `max_turns` -- reasonable default (10-20 for autonomous work)\n5. Calls `client.query(text)`\n6. Iterates `client.receive_response()`, maps each message to AgentEvent:\n   - `AssistantMessage` with `TextBlock` -\u003e `AgentEvent(event_type=\"text\", content=block.text)`\n   - `AssistantMessage` with `ToolUseBlock` -\u003e `AgentEvent(event_type=\"tool\", content=json.dumps({\"tool\": block.name, \"input\": block.input}))`\n   - `ResultMessage` -\u003e `AgentEvent(event_type=\"complete\", content=json.dumps({\"session_id\": msg.session_id}))`\n   - Exception -\u003e `AgentEvent(event_type=\"error\", content=str(error))`\n7. Stores `session_id` from ResultMessage for resume support\n8. Has `async def resume_mission(text, session_id, request_id)` for corrections\n\n### File: `sprite/src/gateway.py` (modify)\n- Import and instantiate `AgentRuntime` (needs Database instance)\n- In `__init__`, accept optional `db: Database` param, create `AgentRuntime(send_fn, db)`\n- Replace `_handle_mission` stub with: extract text from payload, call `self.runtime.run_mission(text, request_id, attachments)`\n- Gateway already has `mission_lock` ensuring serial mission execution\n\n### File: `sprite/src/server.py` (modify)\n- Create Database instance, pass to SpriteGateway constructor\n- Database should be created once per server lifetime (not per connection)\n- Use `async with Database() as db:` in `main()`, pass to `handle_connection`\n\n### Bootstrap and Deployment Updates\n- Add `database.py` and `runtime.py` to `deployCode()` file list in bootstrap.ts\n- Add `claude-agent-sdk\u003e=0.1.17` to sprite/requirements.txt\n- Bump CURRENT_VERSION in bootstrap.ts\n\n### Testing Strategy\n- Mock `ClaudeSDKClient` to avoid real API calls\n- Create mock that yields predefined AssistantMessage/ResultMessage sequences\n- Test event mapping: SDK events -\u003e correct AgentEvent types\n- Test mission_lock: concurrent missions serialize (existing test pattern in test_server.py)\n- Test error handling: exception in SDK -\u003e agent_event with event_type=\"error\"\n- Test session resume: verify ClaudeAgentOptions(resume=session_id) is passed correctly\n\n## Risks\n\n### 1. claude-agent-sdk Dependency (High)\nThe package `claude-agent-sdk` is NOT in sprite/requirements.txt. It MUST be added. Verify it installs cleanly on Sprite VM (Ubuntu 25.04, Python 3.13.3). The SDK wraps the Claude Code CLI (`claude` binary) -- verify the CLI is available on the Sprite VM or is installed as a dependency of the SDK package.\n\n### 2. Claude Code CLI on Sprite VM (High)\nThe Claude Agent SDK spawns `claude` as a subprocess. If the `claude` CLI binary is not installed on the Sprite VM, the SDK will fail at runtime. This needs verification -- either the SDK installs it as a dependency, or it must be installed separately during bootstrap. The Sprite golden image may not have it.\n\n### 3. Task Description vs Architecture Decision Conflict (Medium)\nThe task description says \"Register extraction tools via MCP server with allowed_tools whitelist\" (step 3). But m7b.3.2 was closed as obsolete because v2 uses Bash/Read/Write directly. The Builder should follow the architecture decision (no extraction tool factories) rather than the task literal. Custom MCP tools are only needed for Canvas (m7b.3.4) and OCR (Phase 4). For m7b.3.3, no MCP servers should be registered.\n\n### 4. Database Lifecycle (Medium)\nDatabase instance needs to outlive individual WS connections (Sprite sleep/wake loses TCP but keeps processes). Currently server.py creates gateway per connection. The Database should be module-level or created in main() and passed through. If Bridge reconnects after sleep, a new gateway is created but should reuse the same Database.\n\n### 5. Soul.md Loading (Low)\nThe task says \"load memory -\u003e build system prompt\". But m7b.3.5 (memory system) is a separate downstream task. For m7b.3.3, use a minimal approach: read `/workspace/memory/soul.md` if it exists, fall back to a default system prompt. Full memory loading (user.md, journals, MEMORY.md) belongs to m7b.3.5.\n\n### 6. Event Streaming Backpressure (Low)\nIf the agent generates events faster than the WS can send them, messages could queue in memory. For MVP this is unlikely to be an issue (WS latency ~200ms, events are small). Monitor post-MVP.","created_at":"2026-02-07T12:32:44Z"}]}

Phase 2 will add an API proxy route on Bridge instead.'\n- This is where env vars for `buildExecUrl()` are set when starting the Python server process\n- The exec URL supports `env` params that set environment variables on the Sprite process\n\n### Anthropic SDK Base URL Configuration\n- **Anthropic Python SDK**: Supports `base_url` constructor param AND `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` env var\n  - Example: `Anthropic(base_url='http://bridge:8080/v1/anthropic')`\n  - Or: `export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://bridge:8080/v1/anthropic`\n- **Claude Agent SDK**: Wraps the Claude Code CLI, which respects `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` env var\n  - ClaudeAgentOptions does NOT have a base_url param\n  - But the underlying CLI reads `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` from the process environment\n  - This means: set the env var when launching the Sprite process via exec\n\n### Mistral SDK Base URL Configuration\n- **Mistral Python SDK (v1, Speakeasy-generated)**: Supports `server_url` constructor param\n  - Example: `Mistral(api_key='dummy', server_url='http://bridge:8080/v1/mistral')`\n  - No env var equivalent -- must be passed in code\n  - Also accepts custom `client` (httpx.Client) or `async_client` (httpx.AsyncClient)\n\n### v1 Agent Code (backend/app/agents/extraction_agent/agent.py)\n- Uses `ClaudeSDKClient` from `claude_agent_sdk` with `ClaudeAgentOptions`\n- Creates MCP servers via `create_sdk_mcp_server()`\n- Tool factory pattern: `create_tools(extraction_id, document_id, user_id, db)`\n- The ClaudeSDKClient handles all Anthropic API calls internally via the CLI\n\n### Mistral OCR Usage (backend/app/services/ocr.py)\n- Uses `Mistral(api_key=settings.MISTRAL_API_KEY)` -- lazy singleton\n- Calls `client.ocr.process()` for OCR\n- Runs in thread via `asyncio.to_thread()` (sync client)\n- On Sprite, this would need `server_url` pointing to Bridge proxy\n\n### Sprite Runtime (sprite/src/)\n- Python WebSocket server on port 8765\n- SpriteGateway routes messages, stub handlers only\n- database.py has async SQLite wrapper\n- requirements.txt already includes: anthropic\u003e=0.42.0, mistralai\u003e=1.0.0, httpx\u003e=0.27.0\n- **No runtime.py yet** -- that is m7b.3.3 (blocked by this task)\n\n### Sprite-to-Bridge Connectivity\n- Sprites connect to Bridge via TCP Proxy (WSS, Sprites.dev)\n- Bridge connects to Sprites via TCP Proxy for WS messages\n- **But the proxy route needs HTTP, not WS** -- Sprites must reach Bridge over the internet\n- Bridge is at wss://ws.stackdocs.io (also https://ws.stackdocs.io for HTTP)\n- Fly.io http_service config already handles HTTPS on port 8080\n\n## Implementation Guidance\n\n### Recommended Approach: HTTP Reverse Proxy on Bridge (~80-120 lines)\n\n**New file: bridge/src/api-proxy.ts**\nCreate an HTTP handler function that:\n1. Accepts POST requests on paths like `/v1/proxy/anthropic/*` and `/v1/proxy/mistral/*`\n2. Validates a shared secret token (Sprite identity -- see auth below)\n3. Reads the request body\n4. Forwards to the real API (api.anthropic.com or api.mistral.ai) with the real API key injected\n5. Streams the response back to the Sprite\n\n**Modify: bridge/src/index.ts**\n- In the `createServer` callback, add route matching before the 426 fallback\n- Import and call the proxy handler for matching paths\n- Pattern: `if (req.url?.startsWith('/v1/proxy/')) { return handleApiProxy(req, res); }`\n\n**Sprite-side configuration** (two mechanisms):\n1. **Anthropic (Claude Agent SDK)**: Set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://ws.stackdocs.io/v1/proxy/anthropic` as env var when launching the Sprite process. The env var is injected via the exec URL params in provisioning.ts `getEnvVarsForSprite()`\n2. **Mistral**: In Sprite runtime code, init with `Mistral(api_key='sprite-token', server_url='https://ws.stackdocs.io/v1/proxy/mistral')`. Or set env var and read in code.\n\n### Authentication: Sprite-to-Bridge\nOptions for authenticating proxy requests:\n- **(A) Shared secret token**: Generate a per-sprite or global SPRITES_PROXY_TOKEN, injected as env var on Sprite. Sprite sends it as Bearer token in proxy requests. Bridge validates before forwarding. **Simplest, recommended for MVP.**\n- **(B) Reuse SPRITES_TOKEN**: The Sprites.dev API token is already on Bridge. But it should NOT be on Sprites (it controls VM lifecycle).\n- **(C) Per-stack signed JWT**: Bridge issues a short-lived JWT at connection time, Sprite uses it. More secure but more complex.\n\nRecommendation: **(A)** with a single shared secret for MVP. Add per-stack tokens post-MVP.\n\n### Files to Create/Modify\n1. **CREATE** `bridge/src/api-proxy.ts` -- HTTP proxy handler (~80-120 lines)\n2. **MODIFY** `bridge/src/index.ts` -- Add route to createServer callback (~5 lines)\n3. **MODIFY** `bridge/src/provisioning.ts` -- Add env vars in `getEnvVarsForSprite()` (~5 lines)\n4. **CREATE** `bridge/tests/api-proxy.test.ts` -- Test proxy routes\n5. **Fly.io secret**: `flyctl secrets set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... MISTRAL_API_KEY=... SPRITES_PROXY_TOKEN=...`\n\n### Request Flow\n```\nSprite (Python) --HTTPS--\u003e Bridge (Fly.io) --HTTPS--\u003e api.anthropic.com\n                            |\n                            +-- Validates SPRITES_PROXY_TOKEN\n                            +-- Injects real ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\n                            +-- Streams response back\n```\n\n### Key Implementation Details\n- Use native `fetch()` (Node 22) for outbound requests to Anthropic/Mistral\n- **Stream the response** -- Anthropic SDK uses SSE streaming for messages.create. The proxy must pipe response bodies, not buffer them. Use `res.pipe()` pattern or manual chunk forwarding.\n- Anthropic API expects: `Authorization: Bearer sk-ant-...`, `x-api-key: sk-ant-...`, `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01`\n- The proxy should pass through most headers from the Sprite request, replacing only auth headers\n- Set appropriate CORS headers (none needed -- Sprite-to-Bridge is server-to-server)\n- Add rate limiting per-sprite as a post-MVP concern\n\n### Testing Pattern (from existing tests)\n- Follow bridge/tests/server.test.ts pattern: vitest, mock external deps, real HTTP server\n- Test: valid token forwards and returns response, invalid token returns 401, missing API key returns 503\n- Mock the outbound fetch to Anthropic/Mistral\n\n## Risks\n\n### 1. Streaming Complexity (Medium)\nThe Anthropic Messages API uses SSE streaming. The proxy must forward the streaming response without buffering the entire body first. Node.js native `fetch()` returns a ReadableStream -- need to pipe it correctly to the HTTP response. Test with actual streaming to verify no data loss or latency spikes.\n\n### 2. Mistral SDK server_url Behavior (Low-Medium)\nThe Mistral SDK's `server_url` param was found in Speakeasy-generated source code but is not well-documented. Need to verify at runtime that `Mistral(api_key='token', server_url='https://bridge/v1/proxy/mistral')` correctly prepends the server_url to API paths. If not, may need to use a custom httpx client instead.\n\n### 3. Claude Agent SDK + ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL (Low)\nThe Claude Code CLI respects ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL, but verify this works for ALL API calls the SDK makes (messages, token counting, etc.). The env var approach is well-documented and widely used with proxy services.\n\n### 4. Fly.io Machine Auto-Sleep (Low)\nBridge machine has auto_stop_machines='stop' and min_machines_running=0. When Sprite sends a proxy request, the Bridge Fly machine must be awake. Fly.io auto-starts on incoming HTTP requests, so this should work. But first request after sleep may have ~1-2s cold start latency.\n\n### 5. Memory/CPU on Fly.io (Low)\nBridge is 256MB RAM, shared CPU. Proxying streaming API responses adds memory pressure. For MVP traffic this is fine. Monitor if multiple concurrent extractions cause issues.\n\n### 6. Anthropic API Key Header Format (Low)\nAnthropic uses BOTH `x-api-key` and `Authorization: Bearer` headers. The Python SDK uses `x-api-key`. The proxy must inject the correct header format. Check what the Anthropic SDK sends and match it.\n\n### 7. ANTHROPIC_API_KEY on Sprite for Direct SDK Use (Clarification Needed)\nThe Claude Agent SDK (wrapping CLI) uses ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY. The Sprite needs SOME api_key value for the SDK init even with a proxy. Options: (a) use the proxy token as the api_key value (proxy ignores it, uses real key), (b) use a dummy value. Need to verify the SDK/CLI behavior when api_key is set but base_url points to proxy.","created_at":"2026-02-07T12:14:35Z"}]}
